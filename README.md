# Pangenome Allele Annotation Toolkits (PATs)
The toolkits and pipeline for Pangenome Allele annotation from pangenomes.
Including four partitions:

1. AlleleSearch: the pipeline to search and distract pangenome-alleles
2. Filtration: the pipeline to partite initial gene-groups to gene-group, distract exclusive k-mers for each gene-groups, and filted out sequences not interested such as Tandems.
3. Compile: the pipeline to construct k-mer matrices, phylogenetic trees and pan-gene graphs, then compile to database files used by ctyper.
4. Annotation: the pipeline to Annotate PAs, will help in analyze the interpurate ctyper's genotyping results.


We can provide restricted maintenance for the code in this repository: Although we do not provide warranty to make this pipeline run in all environment, we will provide assistance by request to run it to annotate new pangenome assemblies. For other purpuses and individuel use of single scripts, we may or may not provide maintenance and assistance. 


If you interested in using some of idea or methods include here in your own projects, please email us at wangfeim@usc.edu and mchaisso@usc.edu. We will reply for any request on annotating new pangenome assemblies.
