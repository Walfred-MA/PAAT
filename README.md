# Pangenome Allele Annotation Toolkits (PATs)
The toolkits and pipeline for Pangenome Allele annotation
Including four partitions:

1. AlleleSearch: the pipeline to search and distract pangenome-alleles
2. Filtration: the pipeline to partite initial gene-groups to gene-group, distract exclusive k-mers for each gene-groups, and filted out sequences not interested such as Tandems.
3. Compile: the pipeline to construct k-mer matrices, phylogenetic trees and pan-gene graphs, then compile to database files used by ctyper.
4. Annotation: the pipeline to Annotate PAs, will help in analyze the interpurate ctyper's genotyping results.
